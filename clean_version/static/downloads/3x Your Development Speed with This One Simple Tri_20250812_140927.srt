Title: Efficient Development with Cloud Code for Multiple Features  Introduction: This tutorial focuses on utilizing Cloud Code to enhance development speed by managing multiple features concurrently.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
By setting up separate instances for different features, conflicts can be avoided, and the development process streamlined.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The tools required are Cloud Code, GitHub, and Superbase.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Prior knowledge of Cloud Code, GitHub, and version control concepts is recommended.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Outcome: At the end of this tutorial, you will have established Cloud Code instances for multiple features, enabling simultaneous work on various aspects of a project without conflicts.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Step-by-step instructions: 1.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Create a directory for 3x development speed:    - Open the terminal and create a new directory named "3x development speed".

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
- Navigate into the created directory.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
2.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Initialize Cloud Code:    - Run the command to initialize Cloud Code in the directory.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
- Grant necessary permissions as prompted.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
3.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Install necessary MCPs:    - Install the Superbase MCP using the provided command.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
- Install the GitHub MCP with the provided command.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
- These MCPs allow Cloud Code to interact with Superbase and GitHub.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
4.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Define the purpose of each Cloud Code instance:    - Specify the role of each Cloud Code instance in managing GitHub and issues related to different features.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
- Highlight the significance of branching in Git to prevent conflicts when working on multiple features simultaneously.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
5.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Set up Cloud Code instances for each feature:    - Create separate branches for each feature in your GitHub repository.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
- Check out the code into different directories for independent work on each feature.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
- Modify the code in each branch separately, resolving conflicts before merging.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
6.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Utilize Whisper Flow for collaboration:    - Use Whisper Flow to effectively coordinate and manage development across multiple features.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Final result: By setting up Cloud Code instances for multiple features, you can concurrently work on different aspects of a project.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Utilizing separate branches and directories helps avoid conflicts and accelerates the development process significantly.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
This approach enables efficient management and development of multiple features simultaneously, enhancing productivity and efficiency in software development.
